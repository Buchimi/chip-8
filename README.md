# CHIP-8
CHIP-8 is a simple assembly-like language that runs on a virtual machine. 
We will write an interpreter and environment to run CHIP-8 programs. 
Some would call it an emulator. 
A lot of people have [written games](https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/) that run on CHIP-8, which our emulator will run.
